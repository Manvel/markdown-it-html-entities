# markdown-it-html-entities

Currently [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) follows
[CommonMark specs](https://spec.commonmark.org) which requires HTML Entity
[replacement with Unicode
Character](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#entity-references), though in the
Browsers [HTML
entities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity) are
displayed using relevant characters.

This plugin is for disabling the HTML Entities to Unicode convertion for
markdown-it.

## Usage
